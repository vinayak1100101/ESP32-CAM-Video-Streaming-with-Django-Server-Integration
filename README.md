# ESP32-CAM-Video-Streaming-with-Django-Server-Integration
This project demonstrates how to set up an ESP32-CAM to stream video over Wi-Fi and display it on a web page hosted by a Django server. The ESP32-CAM is programmed using the Arduino IDE, and the video stream is accessed through a web interface built with Django.
